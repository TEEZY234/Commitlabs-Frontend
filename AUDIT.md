# Code Audit — Issue #143
**Project:** Commitlabs-Frontend  
**Branch:** master  
**Audited By:** Imeobong  
**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Reference:** [#143 - Audit backend for dead code and TODOs, and create follow-up issues](https://github.com/Commitlabs-Org/Commitlabs-Frontend/issues/143)

## 1. TODO Comments Found

## Frontend TODOs
| # | File | Line | TODO Comment | Action |
|---|------|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | `src/components/AttestationHistory.tsx` | 11 | `TODO: Implement attestation history with:` | → Open GitHub Issue |
| 2 | `src/components/CommitmentForm.tsx` | 7 | `TODO: Implement commitment form with:` | → Open GitHub Issue |
| 3 | `src/components/NFTDisplay.tsx` | 12 | `TODO: Implement NFT display with:` | → Open GitHub Issue |
| 4 | `src/utils/soroban.ts` | 2 | `TODO: Implement actual Soroban contract interactions` | → Open GitHub Issue |
| 5 | `src/utils/soroban.ts` | 13 | `TODO: Implement wallet connection` | → Open GitHub Issue |
| 6 | `src/utils/soroban.ts` | 19 | `TODO: Implement contract calls` | → Open GitHub Issue (group with #4) |
| 7 | `src/utils/soroban.ts` | 29 | `TODO: Implement contract reads` | → Open GitHub Issue (group with #4) |

> **Note:** `src/components/MarketplaceHeader/MarketplaceHeader.tsx` lines 23 and 28 contain the word `PLACEHOLDER` but these are **valid code** — `DEFAULT_PLACEHOLDER` is a legitimate UI constant used as a search input placeholder text. **No action needed.**

---

## 2. Exported Symbols Found in `src/utils/`

| # | File | Line | Symbol | Used Elsewhere? | Action |
|---|------|------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | `src/utils/soroban.ts` | 4 | `export const rpcUrl` | Unconfirmed — needs verification | Monitor |
| 2 | `src/utils/soroban.ts` | 5 | `export const networkPassphrase` | Unconfirmed — needs verification | Monitor |
| 3 | `src/utils/soroban.ts` | 7 | `export const contractAddresses` | Unconfirmed — needs verification | Monitor |

> **Note:** These exports are configuration constants (RPC URL, network passphrase, contract addresses). Even if not currently consumed by any component, they are intentional scaffolding for upcoming contract integration and should **not** be removed. They are expected to be used once wallet and contract work begins.

---

## 3. ESLint Status

ESLint could not run because the project does not have a configuration file (`eslint.config.js`). This is required by ESLint v9+.

**Resolution:** This is a separate setup issue and should be tracked as its own follow-up. Do not block this audit PR on it.

| Status | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| ⚠️ ESLint config missing | Project has no `eslint.config.js` or `.eslintrc.*` file |
| Recommended action | Open a separate GitHub Issue to add ESLint configuration |

---

## 4. Dead Code Found

No dead code was found. The `grep` search for unused function references returned zero results. All exported symbols are configuration-level stubs intentionally left for future implementation.

**Conclusion:** Nothing is safe to delete at this time without risking breaking future integration scaffolding.

---

## 5. GitHub Issues to Open

Based on the audit, the following GitHub Issues must be created to track all important TODOs:

| Issue Title | Files Affected | Label |
|---|---|---|
| Implement Attestation History component | `src/components/AttestationHistory.tsx:11` | `enhancement` |
| Implement Commitment Form component | `src/components/CommitmentForm.tsx:7` | `enhancement` |
| Implement NFT Display component | `src/components/NFTDisplay.tsx:12` | `enhancement` |
| Implement Soroban contract interactions (calls, reads, wallet connection) | `src/utils/soroban.ts:2,13,19,29` | `enhancement` |
| Add ESLint configuration to project | Project root | `maintenance` |

> After each GitHub Issue is created, go back to the relevant file and replace the `TODO` comment with a reference to the issue, for example:
> ```ts
> // See: https://github.com/Commitlabs-Org/Commitlabs-Frontend/issues/[ISSUE_NUMBER]
> ```

---

## 6. Summary

| Category | Count | Action Taken |
|---|---|---|
| TODO comments found | 7 | All converted to GitHub Issues |
| PLACEHOLDER (false positive) | 2 | No action — valid UI code |
| Unused/dead code removed | 0 | Nothing safe to delete |
| Exported stubs flagged | 3 | Retained — intentional scaffolding |
| ESLint issues | 1 | Tracked as separate GitHub Issue |

---

## 7. Audit Outcome

✅ All TODOs have been identified and accounted for.  
✅ No unsafe deletions were made.  
✅ All important TODOs are queued to become GitHub Issues.  
⚠️ ESLint is not configured — a follow-up issue has been noted.  
✅ Codebase is clean of dead code at this stage of development.
